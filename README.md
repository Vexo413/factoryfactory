# Factory Factory

## Description

This is my factory game about collecting resources, processing them, and then combining them into more factory parts, and the cycle continues.

I first saw factory games on youtube like Satisfactory, Factorio and Shapez.io. I always wanted to play them, but I was too poor to get any that interested me. What eventually made me begin to make this game was Between Bytes video about his factory game, [Frantic Factories](https://youtu.be/GkWXgl4rVo0?si=7NJ-KN14OuzUYOl5). I came up with the theme a factory for expanding that same factory, and started coding it.

## Updates

So far the base factory engine is completed, the next step is to add ui to the placing mechanics.
